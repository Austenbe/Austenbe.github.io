    <p>Hello World</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the blog. I'll be talking about any cool things I'm working on. If I don't get overwhelmed and decide not to do it. 
      The goal of this blog isn't really to teach things, but if someone reads it I'd like it to be interesting and worht their time.
      I just want to start writing things down for myself. Writing stuff down is a great way to make what you've learned really stick.
      It also makes you think about it differently and can cause new discoveries.

      I decided to go with a very simple and static site. Partially because I didn't want to pay for hosting,
      but also because I wanted to see web development from the ground up. That's how I like to learn things.
      I've never been a big web development guy. I always preferred the backend. I've used the new web development frameworks.
      There's so many it makes my head spin. Maybe by making this site the old fashioned way I'll understand why these things exist.
